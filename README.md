RAG House Pricing Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based web application that answers house pricing questions using vector search and semantic retrieval.  
The system combines structured housing data with AI-powered embeddings to generate accurate, data-grounded responses instead of keyword-based results.



Project Motivation

Traditional keyword-based search often fails to capture user intent and semantic meaning.  
This project explores how Vector Search + RAG can improve information retrieval by understanding context, similarity, and meaning.

The idea evolved from:
- Studying Vector Search & Semantic Search
- Presenting a college seminar on "Vector Search Revolutionizing Information Retrieval with AI"
- Implementing concepts practically through a hands-on RAG project



Key Concepts Used

- Vector Embeddings
- Semantic Search
- Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Data-grounded AI responses



System Architecture (High Level)

1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
   - Housing dataset processed using Pandas
2. Embedding Generation
   - Text data converted into vector embeddings
3. Vector Indexing
   - Embeddings stored for similarity search
4. User Query Handling
